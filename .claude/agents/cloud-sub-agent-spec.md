# Cloud Sub-Agent for PRD-to-Code Implementation

## Overview
A comprehensive AI sub-agent designed to read Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) and implement corresponding application pages using existing migrated code files. The agent operates as a best-in-class system that understands page purposes, connects routes and services, and handles authentication requirements.

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. **PRD Analysis Engine**
- **Document Parser**: AI-powered NLP system for extracting structured requirements from PRDs
- **Intent Classification**: Identifies page types, user flows, and functional requirements
- **Dependency Mapping**: Creates relationships between features, services, and authentication needs
- **Priority Scoring**: Ranks implementation order based on dependencies and business value

#### 2. **Code Discovery & Analysis System**
- **File Scanner**: Recursively analyzes migrated codebase structure
- **Component Classifier**: Identifies React components, services, utilities, and configuration files
- **Dependency Graph Generator**: Maps relationships between files and modules
- **API Route Discovery**: Locates existing endpoints and service connections
- **Authentication Pattern Detection**: Identifies auth flows, token handling, and protected routes

#### 3. **Intelligent Implementation Engine**
- **Pattern Matching**: Connects PRD requirements to existing code patterns
- **Route Generator**: Creates React Router configurations based on PRD specifications
- **Component Composer**: Assembles new pages using existing components and patterns
- **Service Integrator**: Connects pages to appropriate APIs and data sources
- **Auth Flow Configurator**: Implements authentication requirements and token management

#### 4. **Validation & Quality System**
- **Code Syntax Validator**: Ensures generated code compiles successfully
- **Integration Tester**: Validates service connections and API calls
- **Route Conflict Detector**: Prevents duplicate or conflicting routes
- **Security Auditor**: Verifies authentication and authorization implementations
- **Performance Analyzer**: Checks for potential performance bottlenecks

## Implementation Workflow

### Phase 1: Discovery & Analysis
1. **PRD Ingestion**
   - Parse PRD documents (PDF, Markdown, Word, etc.)
   - Extract structured requirements using NLP
   - Identify page types: dashboard, form, list, detail, settings, etc.
   - Map user personas to access levels and permissions

2. **Codebase Analysis**
   - Scan all migrated files for patterns and components
   - Build dependency graph showing file relationships
   - Catalog available React components, hooks, and utilities
   - Identify existing API endpoints and service integrations
   - Map authentication patterns and token handling

### Phase 2: Planning & Architecture
1. **Implementation Strategy**
   - Match PRD requirements to existing code patterns
   - Plan new route structure and navigation flows
   - Identify reusable components vs. new implementations
   - Determine authentication requirements for each page

2. **Dependency Resolution**
   - Order implementation based on component dependencies
   - Identify missing services or components that need creation
   - Plan data flow between pages and backend services
   - Validate Firebase/Firestore integration patterns

### Phase 3: Code Generation
1. **Route Implementation**
   - Generate React Router configurations
   - Create nested route structures for complex flows
   - Implement route guards for authentication
   - Add breadcrumb and navigation components

2. **Page Components**
   - Compose pages using existing component library
   - Implement form handling and validation
   - Connect to appropriate API services
   - Add error handling and loading states

3. **Service Integration**
   - Connect pages to Firebase/Firestore collections
   - Implement API calls with proper error handling
   - Add authentication token management
   - Configure real-time data subscriptions where needed

### Phase 4: Quality Assurance
1. **Code Validation**
   - Syntax checking and compilation verification
   - ESLint and TypeScript validation
   - Performance analysis and optimization suggestions

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Verify API connections and data flow
   - Test authentication flows and token handling
   - Validate route navigation and deep linking
   - Check responsive design and accessibility
