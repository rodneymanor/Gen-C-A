React Application Migration Audit Report 
  (Backend-Focused)

  Executive Summary

  This Next.js 15 application migration will focus on
  backend functionality extraction while building
  entirely new UI components. The codebase contains
  906 source files with sophisticated business logic,
  authentication systems, and API integrations that
  need surgical extraction from the existing UI layer.

  Key Findings:
  - Migration Scope: Backend services, APIs, database
  operations, and business logic only
  - UI Strategy: Complete rebuild with new component
  architecture
  - Complexity: High due to tightly coupled business
  logic within existing components
  - Extraction Challenge: Separating business logic
  from presentation layer

  Critical Path Components (Backend Only)

  1. Core Services & Business Logic (Priority 1)

  // Essential backend services to extract
  src/lib/                          // Business logic 
  and utilities

  and abstractions
  src/server/                       // Server-side 
  functions
  src/contexts/                     // State 
  management (logic extraction)
  src/hooks/                        // Custom hooks 
  (business logic only)

  2. Authentication & RBAC System (Priority 1)

  access control

  3. API Layer (Priority 2)

  // All API routes and services
  src/app/api/                      // Next.js API 
  routes
  src/lib/services/                 // Service layer 
  abstractions
  src/lib/*-service.ts              // Individual 
  service modules

  4. Database Operations (Priority 3)

  // Firestore operations and data models
  src/lib/collections*.ts           // Collections 
  management
  src/lib/firebase-*.ts             // Database 
  helpers

  Risk Assessment (Backend-Focused)

  Critical Risk (ðŸ”´ Immediate Attention Required)

  1. Business Logic Extraction Complexity
  - Issue: Business logic tightly coupled with React
  components
  - Impact: Incomplete functionality extraction,
  missing business rules
  - Mitigation: Systematic component analysis, logic
  abstraction into pure functions

  2. State Management Extraction
  - Issue: Complex React Context providers mixing UI
  and business state
  - Impact: Lost state management patterns, broken
  data flow
  - Mitigation: Extract state logic into standalone
  state managers (Zustand/Redux)

  High Risk (ðŸŸ¡ Requires Careful Planning)

  3. Authentication Integration Points
  - Issue: Auth context deeply integrated with
  component lifecycle
  - Impact: Broken authentication flows in new UI
  - Mitigation: Create auth service abstractions,
  implement auth hooks for new UI

  4. API Integration Patterns
  - Issue: React Query integration mixed with
  component logic
  - Impact: Lost data fetching patterns, caching
  strategies
  - Mitigation: Extract API clients, document data
  fetching patterns

  Business Logic Extraction Strategy

  Component Logic Analysis Pattern

  // Example: Collections management component
  // BEFORE (tightly coupled)
  const CollectionsComponent = () => {
    const { user } = useAuth();
    const [collections, setCollections] =
  useState([]);

    const handleCreateCollection = async (data) => {
      // Business logic mixed with UI
      const newCollection = await
  createCollection(user.uid, data);
      setCollections(prev => [...prev,
  newCollection]);
      toast.success("Collection created");
    };

    return <div>{/* UI JSX */}</div>;
  };

  // AFTER (extracted services)
  // New service for business logic
  export class CollectionsService {
    static async createCollection(userId: string, 
  data: CollectionData) {
      // Pure business logic
      return await createCollection(userId, data);
    }

    static async getUserCollections(userId: string) {
      return await getUserCollections(userId);
    }
  }

  // Interface for new UI integration
  export const useCollectionsService = () => {
    return {
      createCollection:
  CollectionsService.createCollection,
      getUserCollections:
  CollectionsService.getUserCollections,
      // ... other methods
    };
  };

  State Management Extraction

  // Extract React Context business logic
  // OLD: AuthContext with UI coupling
  // NEW: AuthService + AuthStore for new UI 
  integration

  export class AuthService {
    static async signIn(email: string, password: 
  string) {
      // Extracted auth logic
    }

    static async getCurrentUser() {
      // Pure auth operations
    }
  }

  export const createAuthStore = () => ({
    user: null,
    loading: false,
    signIn: AuthService.signIn,
    getCurrentUser: AuthService.getCurrentUser,
    // State management for new UI
  });

  New UI Integration Specification

  Service Interfaces for New UI

  // Provide clean interfaces for new component 
  integration
  export interface CollectionsServiceInterface {
    getUserCollections(userId: string):
  Promise<Collection[]>;
    createCollection(userId: string, data:
  CollectionData): Promise<Collection>;
    updateCollection(id: string, data:
  Partial<CollectionData>): Promise<void>;
    deleteCollection(id: string): Promise<void>;
  }

  export interface AuthServiceInterface {
    getCurrentUser(): Promise<User | null>;
    signIn(email: string, password: string):
  Promise<void>;
    signOut(): Promise<void>;
    onAuthStateChanged(callback: (user: User | null) 
  => void): () => void;
  }

  Success Metrics (Backend-Focused)

  - Service Extraction Completeness: 100% business
  logic migrated to services
  - API Parity: All endpoints functioning identically
  in new system
  - Data Integrity: Zero data loss during service
  migration
  - Service Performance: <5% performance degradation
  in extracted services
  - Integration Readiness: Complete service interfaces
   for new UI development

  Total Estimated Timeline: 28-32 weeks

  This migration approach ensures complete separation
  of business logic from presentation layer, providing
   clean service interfaces for your new UI components
   while preserving all existing functionality and
  data.
