## Test Configuration

### Vitest Configuration (`vite.config.ts`)

```typescript
test: {
  globals: true,
  environment: 'jsdom',
  setupFiles: './src/test/setup.ts',
  css: true,
  reporters: ['verbose'],
  coverage: {
    reporter: ['text', 'json', 'html'],
    exclude: [
      'node_modules/',
      'src/test/',
      '**/*.d.ts',
      '**/*.test.{ts,tsx}',
      '**/*.spec.{ts,tsx}',
    ],
  },
}
```

### Test Setup (`src/test/setup.ts`)

- Jest DOM matchers configuration
- Framer Motion mocking for animations
- IntersectionObserver and ResizeObserver mocking
- matchMedia API mocking
- CSS variables mocking for consistent styling
- Global test utilities

### Test Utilities (`src/test/test-utils.tsx`)

- Custom render function with providers
- Mock data factories (createMockCollection, createMockContentItem, etc.)

- Complex child components mocked when testing parent integration
- API calls mocked with predictable responses

### Data Mocking
- Comprehensive mock data factories for all entity types

## Continuous Integration

### Pre-commit Hooks
- Type checking with `npm run type-check`
- Linting with `npm run lint`
- Test execution with `npm run test:run`

### CI Pipeline Checks

- Linting compliance

## Maintenance Guidelines

### Adding New Tests
1. Follow existing test patterns and naming conventions
2. Include both positive and negative test cases
3. Test edge cases and boundary conditions
4. Ensure accessibility compliance
5. Update mock data as needed

### Updating Existing Tests
1. Maintain backward compatibility when possible
2. Update mock data to reflect schema changes
3. Preserve test intent while updating implementation
4. Document breaking changes

### Test Performance
1. Keep tests fast and focused
2. Use appropriate mocking to isolate concerns
3. Avoid testing implementation details
4. Focus on user-visible behavior

## Known Issues and Limitations

### Current Test Limitations
1. Visual regression testing not implemented
2. End-to-end testing requires separate setup
3. Performance testing is basic
4. Browser compatibility testing limited to jsdom

### Future Improvements
1. Add visual regression testing with Percy or similar
2. Implement Cypress for E2E testing
3. Add performance benchmarking
4. Expand accessibility testing with axe-core
5. Add component interaction testing with Storybook

## Regression Prevention Strategy

### Code Changes
- All new features require corresponding tests
- Bug fixes must include regression tests
- Refactoring must maintain existing test coverage

### Component Updates
- Breaking changes require test updates
- New props and features need test coverage
- Deprecated functionality should have migration tests

### API Changes
- Mock data must reflect API schema changes
- Type definitions need validation tests
- Error handling requires negative test cases

## Test Results Interpretation

### Passing Tests
- All functionality working as expected
- No regressions detected
- Code ready for deployment

### Failing Tests
- Investigate failing test immediately
- Determine if issue is in code or test
- Fix root cause before proceeding
- Update tests if requirements changed

### Coverage Reports
- Identify untested code paths
- Prioritize testing critical functionality
- Investigate coverage drops
- Maintain or improve coverage over time

This comprehensive testing suite ensures the Gen.C Alpha Dashboard maintains high quality, accessibility, and reliability across all future changes and enhancements.
