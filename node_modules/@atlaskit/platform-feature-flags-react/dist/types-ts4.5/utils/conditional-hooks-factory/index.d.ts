/**
 * A factory function to create a conditional hook. The condition must return a boolean value
 * that does not change after initialisation. This function will cache the result of the condition
 * and use it to determine which hook to call. If the condition changes between renders,
 * unexpected behaviour may occur.
 *
 * The hook generated by this factory will also force the condition to be effectively constant
 * by caching the result of the condition on the first call. In non-production environments,
 * it will throw an error if the condition changes between renders to help catch potential issues.
 *
 * If for some reason you need to reset the cache (i.e. for tests where you change the condition between runs),
 * you can call `DO_NOT_USE_THIS_IN_PRODUCTION_EVER_resetConditionalHooksFactoryCache()`.
 *
 * **This hook should only be used for Feature Gates & Experiments where the value doesn't change.**
 * ```ts
 * // Acceptable use
 * const useMyHook = conditionalHooksFactory(
 *   () => isFeatureEnabled('my-feature'),
 *   useMyNewHook,
 *   useMyOldHook,
 * );
 *
 * // Not acceptable use
 * const useMyHook = conditionalHooksFactory(
 *    () => someVarThatCouldChange === 'my-value',
 *    useMyNewHook,
 *    useMyOldHook,
 * );
 * ```
 *
 * @param condition The condition function that will be used to determine which hook to call.
 * @param newHook The new hook to call if the condition is true.
 * @param oldHook The old hook to call if the condition is false.
 * @returns A migrator hook that will call either the new hook or the old hook based on the condition.
