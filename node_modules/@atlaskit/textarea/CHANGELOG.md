  Migrated from `@emotion/react` to `@compiled/react` in order to improve performance, align with
  the rest of the Atlaskit techstack, and support React 18 Streaming SSR. Please note, in order to
  use this version of `@atlaskit/textarea`, you will need to ensure that your bundler is configured
  to handle `.css` imports correctly.

  Most bundlers come with built-in support for `.css` imports, so you may not need to do anything.
  If you are using a different bundler, please refer to the documentation for that bundler to
  understand how to handle `.css` imports. For more information on the migration, please refer to
  [RFC-73 Migrating our components to Compiled CSS-in-JS](https://community.developer.atlassian.com/t/rfc-73-migrating-our-components-to-compiled-css-in-js/85953).

  [`782b6e5182`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/782b6e5182) - ### Brief

  The goal of this major for textarea is to improve the component's performance, by both

  reducing static structure and avoiding unnecessary function calls.

  We have made internal refactors and optimizations to improve textarea performance. Some changes
  made are as follows:

  - Moving TextArea to a single element (removed an internal wrapping element)

  - Replace `styled-components` to `emotion` as styling library

  - Moving internal component analytics to a more efficient usePlatformLeafEventHandler hook

  - Refactoring styles to recalculate only when theme & certain props change

  - Controlling CSS change via attributes instead of props

  #### TextArea now has single DOM element

  DOM element 2 -> 1 Removed div surrounding (wrapper) native textarea element and moved all
  behaviors and CSS to that single element.

  Measuring the height of the textarea element will now get different raw values because the text
  area is now rendering it’s own padding and border, but computed height is still the same.

  #### Upgrading with codemod

  ```

  # You first need to have the latest textarea installed before you can run the codemod

  yarn upgrade @atlaskit/textarea@^4.0.0
  ```

# Run the codemod cli

# Pass in a parser for your codebase

npx @atlaskit/codemod-cli /path/to/target/directory --parser [tsx | flow | babel]
