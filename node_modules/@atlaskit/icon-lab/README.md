# Icon Labs

An icon package for public icon contributions

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @atlaskit/icon-lab
```

## Usage

Icons should be used intentionally to maximize comprehension and reduce cognitive load. Use it to
call attention to a particular action, command, or section. If you’re questioning an icon’s use, it
probably doesn’t need to be used.
