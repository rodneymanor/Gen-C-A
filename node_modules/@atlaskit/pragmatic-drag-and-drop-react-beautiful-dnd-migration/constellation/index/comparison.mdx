## UX

The user experience (UX) provided by this migration layer differs slightly to that of
`react-beautiful-dnd`.

## Sensors

The migration layer does not use the same concept of sensors as `react-beautiful-dnd`.

### Default sensors

Disabling default sensors is no longer supported.

Pointer and keyboard dragging are supported by default, equivalent to the default
`react-beautiful-dnd` sensors:

- `useMouseSensor`
- `useTouchSensor`
- `useKeyboardSensor`

### Custom sensors

Custom sensors are no longer supported.

## Combining items

Combining items is no longer supported.

The main use case of combining is trees, for which there are more suitable packages. If you are
looking for a tree package, please reach out to us and we can help you with next steps.

## Props

### Unsupported props

A number of props are no longer supported. They will be accepted but won't have any effect.

#### `<DragDropContext>`

```diff
# Custom sensors are not supported.
# The migration layer supports pointer and keyboard dragging.
- sensors?: Sensors[];

# Disabling default sensors is not supported.
- enableDefaultSensors?: boolean;
```

#### `<Droppable>`

```diff
# Combining items is not supported.
- isCombineEnabled?: boolean;

# The browser now determines all hit targets.
- ignoreContainerClipping?: boolean;
```

#### `<Draggable>`

```diff
# The browser now determines when drags should occur.
- shouldRespectForcePress?: boolean;
```
